# Guidelines for Olve.Results.Validation

This library contains small validator helpers built on top of **Olve.Results**.
They provide fluent checks that return `Result` or can be implicitly converted to one.

Keep this document up to date when adding new validators or API changes.
`workflow-triggers.txt` lists files that trigger NuGet publishing when modified.
